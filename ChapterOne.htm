<b>Chapter One</b>
<p>

       “Alright, Mom and Dad, I’ll be going out for my 12th time hunting for food with my brother,” Flipper, a ten year old boy, announced, waving back to his parents. Flipper was wearing inexpensive clothing; his black hair and eyes didn’t look well with this kind of fashion. Without saying good-bye, his father only showed an uneasy face.<br>
       “Have fun,” Flipper’s sister smiled, but Flipper suspected something beyond her smile.<br>
       “What’s wrong, Sis?” <br>
       She looked up as if there was nothing wrong, “Oh, nothing,” she just said. “You remember where he – your brother, of course - lives, correct? Jeez, when you go hunting with our big bro...you just seem...older.”<br>
       Flipper nodded. “Alright, I’ll be seeing you later.” <br>
       He reached for his bow on shelf and put on his white bandana. <i>No matter what, my White Bandana will keep me company…</i> That White Bandana once belonged to his favorite cousin, Kane, who died in a war. <br>
                                       *               *                 *     <br>
       Flipper knocked on the door. “Anyone home? Brother?”<br>
       Though he knocked several times, the house did not respond. Therefore, Flipper became irritated. “What’s wrong with you today, Brother? Why aren’t you answering? So be it. I’ve been waiting out here for a while. What do I get? No response. Hmph.”<br>
       <i>But brother…Why? Why won’t you answer? I even notified you…</i><br>
       Flipper gave up and took a stroll to what he called ‘the hunting ground.’<br>
                                       *               *                 *     <br>
       As Flipper returned to the house he lived in, he notice something very peculiar – his parents and his sister did not greet him. He opened the door and to his surprise, everything in the house was wrecked. At first sight, he was shocked and then, noticed a fire in the background. <br>
       “Shoot! Where is it?! Argh! Screw this!” Flipper groaned, making his way down to the lower floor. “Oh my….god!”
       Lying before him was his sister, Naomi. He kneeled down, but he did not cry. <i?I don’t understand. Fire?! Who did this!?</i><br>
       The house began to deteriorate and fall apart. “Mom, where are you? I need you! Why aren’t you here when I just needed you? You’re always there for me! Dad!” As he tried to pull his sister along with him to the exit built for emergency issues; a piece of wood caught on fire fell on him, bringing him down. Before him was the object that may save his life. He attempted to reach it but then…the world seemed to collapse on him……<br>
                                       *               *                 *  <br>   
       Flipper slowly opened his eyes. Lifting himself, he discovered his was in a complete, different environment.<i> Where am I? </i><br>
       “He has awakened…” Flipper could barely hear the voice.<br>
       Someone, supposedly a girl around Flipper’s age, entered the room. “Oh, please. Don’t hurt him. He didn’t do anything.” <br>
       All Flipper could see was the silhouette of the two images. “Where am I? What do you want? Where are my mom and dad? Answer me…” Flipper faintly cried.<br>
       The girl giggled, “He’s cute.”<br>
       “Don’t worry, little boy. You’ll find out sooner or later…” The unknown person said.<br>
       Before Flipper blacked out, words came out from his mouth. “Mother…”<p>
[Years Later...]<p>

       “Eh. What a pleasant day,” Flipper stated, sitting on a bench in the town of Henesys. “Yet, I don’t even know how much money I have in my pockets. Oh, well.” <br>
       Four years had passed and yet, he had to live the hard way by stealing. I hope you forgive me, mother. I never meant to do these things but I have to. How else would I survive in this world? I wish you were still here, Naomi. You always made the sun shine. But now, it’ll never be the same. There’s no one out there to replace you…<br>
        Flipper’s dad was ancient history to him; Flipper had no memory of him. Something laid in front of him. <i>What is it?</i><br>
        Picking it up, he realized that it was an advertisement for a specific contest.<br>
         “ ‘Looking for someone with great talent. Come to Henesys and join the fun! Winner will receive a prize of 300, 000 mesos.’ ” Flipper read aloud. “Heh, I think I could do that. 300,000 mesos would surely help.”<br>
         As soon Flipper rose from the bench, he heard a loud shriek.<br>
         “Go away!” Someone had shriek. <br>
         Flipper perceived the sound of running feet and it was only getting louder; therefore, Flipper assumed it was getting closer.<br>
         “Get away!” This time, a girl came dashing by, past Flipper. <br>
         <i>What’s going on?</i><br>
         “Don’t let her escape!” Someone had ordered.<br>
         With that, Flipper saw two men (#1 and #2) pursuing the girl. What’s going on??! I better help.<br>
         “Heh, you’re cornered,” one of the men (#3) smirked. There were two pursuers on the girl’s right (#1 and #2) and one on the her left (#3). “Easy, now. We can’t let you leave with that valuable piece of information, can we?”<p>

[Dream]<br>
         “Hey, you’re awake,” the girl from before turned around to see Flipper conscious. “I see, you’re still injured from that incident. No worries, I’ll get you fixed up.”<br>
         Flipper squinted. “So, where exactly am I? What incident?”<br>
         “My name is Naomi.”<br>
         “Don’t change the topic! Where am I? By the way, somehow I recall my sister’s name…It’s like yours…N-n-”<br>
         “Naomi as well? Well, I'm not your sister.”<br>
         “At least I think so.”<br>
         “Anyway, where was I? Oh, yes, back to your question.”<br>
[End of Dream]<p>

         <i>Arg…I must be daydreaming again…..Stupid dreams. What do they mean? Nothing, that’s what…But why are they…why? Why do they continue like a never-ending story? Whatever…Just dreams...</i><p>
 


[Dream]<br>
         “Go on,” Flipper said, waiting impatiently.<br>
         “Ahem, as I was saying, you’re in my master’s lair.”<br>
         “Your what?”<br>
         “My master’s lair.”<br>
         “Who is your master?”<br>
         But Naomi didn’t answer; she seemed to be drifting off.<br>
         “Answer!” Flipper demanded.<br>
[End of Dream]<p>

         “H-help!” <br>
         “I’m coming!” Flipper shouted.<br>
         “Tsk, someone dares to interfere?” One of the pursuers (#2) smirked. <p>    
  
[Dream]<br>
         “Oh, my bad. I got carried away,” Naomi sighed.<br>
         “So…who exactly is your master?” Flipper inquired.<br>
         “Oh, you must’ve meant Master Rydra!”<br>
         “Master Rydra?”<br>
[End of Dream]<p>

         In a fighting stance, one of the men (#1) took out a weapon, and stepped toward Flipper . <br>
         “Heh, you think you can beat me?” Flipper sneered with confidence.<br>
         “What? Are you going to save your girlfriend?” The man (#1) wielding a weapon taunted.<br>
         “Maybe, maybe not.”<p>

[Dream]<br>
         Naomi paused, then asked, “Would you like to meet my master?”<br>
         Flipper nodded.<br>
         “Alright, I’ll take you to him.”<br>
[End of Dream]<p>

          Flipper grabbed an arrow and shot it at one of the pursuers but to his surprise, Flipper missed. <i>Damn it. Where did he go?</i><br>
         “Looking for me?”
         As Flipper whirled around, his back began to ache. He felt a throbbing pain and then, noticed red fluid on the floor….. <i>Blood....</i> <br>
         Before he could get up, everything began to fail; first off, his vision. The world started to fall and all he remembered, before fainting, was the clash of swords.
